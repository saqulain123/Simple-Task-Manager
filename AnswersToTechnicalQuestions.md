### 1. How long did you spend on the coding test?
I spent approximately *18-20 hours* on the coding test. This time included:

- Planning and understanding the requirements
- Implementing core features such as adding, editing, deleting, and filtering tasks
- Styling the user interface for a clean, intuitive experience
- Testing to ensure all functionalities worked as expected in different scenarios

### 2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.

One of the most useful features in recent JavaScript updates is *optional chaining (?.)*. This feature simplifies accessing deeply nested properties in an object without having to check each level manually. It reduces code verbosity and handles cases where some properties might be undefined.

I used optional chaining in my JavaScript code to safely access properties within the task object without risking runtime errors.

#### Code Snippet
```javascript
// Accessing nested property safely using optional chaining
const taskPriority = task?.priority ?? 'Low'; // Defaults to 'Low' if priority is undefined
In this example, task?.priority ensures that if task is undefined or null, it wonâ€™t throw an error. Instead, the code will assign 'Low' as the default priority if task.priority is not defined.
